#Overview

This is a repository that documents my development of my ePortfolio for the SNHU CS 499 Computer Science Capstone. Creating an ePortfolio that showcases my abilities is a great tool for communication for potential employers. 
This portfolio is a way to show my knowledge that has been absorped in my time within this program at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio includes software and engineering design, algorithms and data structure, as well a databases.

The original artifacts were submitted in JAVA, but then translated to C++ within this capstone. I am proud of my work within this course, and I am going to continue to improve upon this work continuously, to remain current in my 
coding knowledge. 

##Self-Reflection

In this repository, I have translated an entire project from JAVA to C++. This took a long time to compile, but I believe this was worth the work.
